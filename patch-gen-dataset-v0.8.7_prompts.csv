"Create a Pure Data patch that generates random numbers at a specified interval, but only allows the numbers to pass through for a certain amount of time after the initial input."
"Create a Pure Data patch that compares two numbers using conditional statements (greater than, less than, etc.) and triggers different outputs based on the result."
"Create a Pure Data patch for a 4th-order lowpass filter with signal-controlled frequency and Q, taking three signal inputs: the signal to be filtered, the cutoff frequency in Hz, and the Q value."
"Create a Pure Data patch that takes an input and randomly outputs it with a user-settable probability, defaulting to 50%, and also accepts an argument or a second inlet to change the probability."
"Create a Pure Data patch that generates and manipulates numbers, with options to change the numbers and reset them to default values."
Create a Pure Data patch that generates sound using an oscillator with pitch and dynamics controlled by input lists.
Create a Pure Data patch that implements a soft leveller with feedforward automatic gain control (AGC) to regulate the amplitude of an audio signal.
"Create a Pure Data patch that generates a variety of window functions, including Hamming, Welch, Bartlett, Gaussian, Hanning, Blackman, Nuttall, Blackman-Nuttall, Blackman-Harris, square, and flat-top, with adjustable window size and Gaussian bend parameters."
Create a Pure Data patch that performs a logical OR operation on two input values and outputs the result.
"Create a Pure Data patch that takes a single input, extracts three float values from a list when triggered, and prints the values to the console."
Create a Pure Data patch that displays a canvas with the text 'hello' on it.
"Create a Pure Data patch that loops through integers when triggered by a bang, with a parameter to set the number to loop at, and a reset option to start the loop from 0."
Create a Pure Data patch that takes an interval in semitones as input and outputs an approximate pitch ratio.
"Create a Pure Data patch that controls the desaturation and texture of a GLSL shader, with default values and initialization."
"Create a Pure Data patch that implements a conditional statement with three variables, where if the first variable is equal to itself, the patch outputs the value of the second variable, otherwise it outputs the value of the third variable."
"Create a Pure Data patch that demonstrates emission color control with a 3D cube, allowing users to toggle lighting and adjust emission colors."
"Create a Pure Data patch that takes two input values, selects one of them based on a condition, and outputs the selected value and the other value separately."
"Create a Pure Data patch that takes three input signals, applies a toggle switch to the third input, and then routes the first two inputs to separate spigot objects, which are controlled by the toggled third input, and finally sends the output of the spigots to a single outlet."
"Create a Pure Data patch that receives OSC input, prints it, and routes 'edit' messages to a GUI output, while also printing GUI output and sending GUI input."
Create a Pure Data patch that adds two input values together and displays the result
"Create a Pure Data patch that generates a random number within a scalable range, with the range and scaling factor controlled by external inputs, and outputs the result."
"Create a Pure Data patch that generates a sine tone with an amplitude envelope, applies a basic rhythm using a sequencer, and occasionally changes the delay time randomly."
